    "### Challenge 3c: Anagram Detector üëØ\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once (e.g., \"listen\" and \"silent\"; \"triangle\" and \"integral\"). Write a function that takes two strings and returns `True` if they are anagrams of each other, and `False` otherwise.\n",

    "**Hints:**\n",
    "*   Again, consider ignoring spaces and capitalization.\n",
    "*   If two strings are anagrams, what can you say about them if you sort their letters?\n",
    "*   Alternatively, how could you use the letter frequency counting idea from Challenge 3a?"
